            <p className="mainContent"> I'm a recent graduate from Hack Your Future, Copenhagen (HYF), a non profit coding school which helps students in acquiring the necessary skills to become web developers. 
                I have extensive experience in customer service, which has taught me to be a people person. 
               <br /> 
                My passion for coding started when I was looking for a career change and started looking for some IT courses until I came across HYF 
                and since then there has been no looking back . I have worked on different projects and I have experience working with Html, CSS, Javascript, NodeJs, ExpressJs, ReactJs and MySQL</p>
