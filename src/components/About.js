            <p className="mainContent">A frontend developer with experience in Svelte and ReactJS framework. I started on my web development journey 2 years ago with a course in Full stack development  at Hack Your Future. Throughout the course we had hands on experience building projects with ReactJS and NodeJS. After which I found an intership for 6 months, where I mainly focussed on UX designing and also build responsive web pages. Soon enough I landed a full time position at Exitplanner, where I have build features using Svelte, SvelteKit, Hasura, GraphQL and Tailwind CSS. I also gained skills in writing clean, manageable and reusable code.  </p>
